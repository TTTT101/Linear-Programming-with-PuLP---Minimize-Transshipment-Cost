# Minimize-Transshipment-Cost---Linear-Programming-with-PuLP

The transshipment problem is a transportation problem, in which goods are moved from suppliers to customers through intermediate nodes (or transshipment points). These transshipment points allow minimizing the total transportation cost by finding the nodes that create the most cost-effective route. 

Nodes represent suppliers, warehouses, distribution centers, consumers, etc. Constraints include but not limit to supply capacities and demand. The objective function is to minimize the total transportation cost that satified the constraints. 

In this post, I am using Linear Programming to solve the problem.

## Data Description
The data table consists of 5 columns and 21 rows. 'Start' column represents the origin cities and 'End' column represents the destination cities.
